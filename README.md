# SOM-TSP-Machine-Learning
Kohonen SOM for Learning the Traveling salesman problem (TSP)
In this code, we illustrate the use of the linear topology for the cluster units in a Kohonen self-ofganizing map to sole a classic problem in constrained optimization, the so-called traveling salesman problem(TSP). The aim of the TSP is to find a tour of a given set of cities that is of minimum length. A tour consists of visiting each city exactly one and returning to the starting city. The net has a linear topology, with the first and last cluster units.
After open the code by Matlab you can run it by pressing option-command-R. you can see the figure to press cities location distances with mouse clicking, after finish the cities position, click the enter for continiuing program.
